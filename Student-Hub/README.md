What is public learning?
Public learning is basically the process of documenting something u learn or come to know about and putting it out for the world to see/contribute/collaborate on.
Public learning is emerging as the most effective and widely used learning technique.Basically if you have taken help from any of these websites like stackoverflow,wikihow,reddit,youtube..you are a part of it as you have used knowledge available in the public contributed and developed by people just like us and used it for your own purpose.
The aim of the website is to develop a community where users can add/share their learning progress/resources utilized and experiences about the same, It can be in the form of blogs or through forum discussion threads.

Achievemens:
1) Users can find all the resources of different domains at one place which helps them to save their time and energy.
2) Most of the students face huge difficulties during interview preparation. Reading otherâ€™s experiences helps them to know about the 3) interview process for different companies of different domains.
