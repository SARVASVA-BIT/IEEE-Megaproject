Abstract idea
We have decided to make a website that can provide self-employment to the people based on their skills. The need of the hour is to provide employment opportunities to the people.  The number of unemployed people are rising everyday and it is our duty as a responsible citizen to help in the welfare of the people which in turn will contribute towards the development of our nation.

In this website, we will make a login page where people (who require employment) can make their account. After that there will be quick survey questions where we will record their personal details along with their skills- carpentry, electrician, plumbing, tutor, repair, etc.

Similarly, the people (customers) who want to take their services can sign up and then they can select the required laborer in their area. The laborer can be contacted through his contact number after which he can reach the customer and do the required job. 

This idea will help to solve the problem of unemployment as both skilled and unskilled laborers will be able to get freelancing jobs every day. Moreover, the laborer can be employed full time by a company/firm if needed. To simplify the login task for uneducated people, there will be option to translate the page in their native language as well as their will be customer care details to help through the login task.

Thank you
