Idea: - The idea behind this project is to provide end-to-end encryption and to make it safer to convey/send secret messages in an encrypted way to minimize the risk of breach.
i.e. Encrypter-Decrypter.

Achievements: - This project aims to provide a 2-level authentication interface i.e. a PIN and the length of PIN should be of 4 digits only to be valid. The person who is encrypting will generate a 4-digit secret code and the one who's decrypting it should have to know about the exact length (4 digit) and the exact pin to decipher the text. 

How to run: - Step 1: Open the code.
              Step 2: Run the code.
              Step 3: An application will open after the complete build of code i.e. GUI
              Step 4: Encryption :-
                           Enter the text and a 4-digit secret code to Encrypt.
                      Decryption :-
                           Enter the encrypted text and the same secret 4-digit code to Decrypt the text.
If any invalid pin is entred a error pop's up and ask's for a retry.
